# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Enhanced Judiciary Platform is a comprehensive full-stack web application that connects users with verified lawyers and provides AI-powered case prediction services. The platform features role-based authentication, lawyer verification through DigiLocker integration, comprehensive lawyer profiles with performance analytics, intelligent search capabilities, and an AI chatbot for case outcome prediction. The system aims to democratize access to legal services while providing data-driven insights for better legal decision-making.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Authentication and Role Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to register and login with role-based access so that I can access features appropriate to my user type (regular user, lawyer, or admin).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new user registers THEN the system SHALL create an account with default "user" role
2. WHEN a user attempts to login THEN the system SHALL authenticate credentials and redirect based on role
3. WHEN a lawyer registers THEN the system SHALL create an unverified lawyer account pending DigiLocker verification

5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear session data and redirect to login page

### Requirement 2: Multi-Method Lawyer Verification System

**User Story:** As a lawyer, I want to verify my credentials through multiple practical verification methods so that I can access lawyer-specific features and build trust with potential clients.

**Implementation Note:** After thorough research, DigiLocker API requires government partnership for production deployment, making it unfeasible for academic projects. This system implements practical alternatives that demonstrate equivalent technical competencies while being deployable.

13. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL queue for admin review with manual flag

**Admin Review Workflow:**
14. WHEN admin accesses verification queue THEN the system SHALL display pending verifications with all submitted data
15. WHEN admin reviews verification THEN the system SHALL allow approval/rejection with mandatory comments
16. WHEN admin decision is made THEN the system SHALL update lawyer status and log decision with timestamp
17. WHEN verification status changes THEN the system SHALL send email notification to lawyer with status and comments
